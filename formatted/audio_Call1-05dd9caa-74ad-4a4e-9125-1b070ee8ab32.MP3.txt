Customer [starttime: 00:12 - endtime: 01:35]: Hi. This is ***** *********. My ID number is *******. I have an issue with my PC earlier. It's suddenly free nonstop. Like it's just free. After that, the money pointed Blue saying, let me check. Your device, run into a problem and needs to restore it. So after a few minutes, it says checking media preferences like some error. And then when I tried to restart the PC when it pulled up, it says attempting to repairs, but it says that the repair did not work and then there is, like, some option to select. So I tried to shut down the PC. I meant to turn it off. And then when I turn it back in from the money again for Blue, it says that I think needs to be recovered and then it suddenly shut down.

Agent [starttime: 01:35 - endtime: 01:40]: Do you see if that is a recovering key?

Customer [starttime: 01:40 - endtime: 02:25]: Yeah, the recovery. Yeah, it needs PC recovery and then it shut down. So I waited, like, 5 minutes.
