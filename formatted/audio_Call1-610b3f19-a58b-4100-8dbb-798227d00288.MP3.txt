Speaker 1 [starttime: 06:45 - endtime: 07:10]: No, because these are my bookmarks. I don't have the BMS link here because it opens automatically every single morning. So I never felt the need to pull it here because every time I press a pro sign, the BMS opens anyway. But now that I'm in private, it's not doing. So I'm asking, How do I get the link then? Because I'm going to need to do my time sheet. I'm going to look at it. I'm going to need to look at communications all of this.
