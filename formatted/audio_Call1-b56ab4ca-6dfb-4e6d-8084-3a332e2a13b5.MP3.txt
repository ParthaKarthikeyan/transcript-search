Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:23 - endtime: 11:52]: So you shouldn't be putting something that is that you have used earlier. It should be a new one. I need to hold a special character, a number and an uppercase and a strong password. The temple is an easy one because we are giving it so that the user can change it nicely or easily. But then you cannot use the same that will not take.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 11:52 - endtime: 11:58]: It's not the same as I think. Probably the one I had before this.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:58 - endtime: 13:00]: Yeah, that is why it's not taking. You will have to use something that is new. The old one.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 13:00 - endtime: 13:07]: Ok, yes, that's all work now.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 13:06 - endtime: 13:11]: OK, it's working fine for you. Everything is done, sir.
