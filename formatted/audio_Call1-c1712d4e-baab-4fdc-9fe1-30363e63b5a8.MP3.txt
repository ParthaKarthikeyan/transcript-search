Speaker 2 [starttime: 00:05 - endtime: 02:20]: Thank you for contacting ID support. My name is *****. How can I help you? Hi. This is ***** *******. I was supposed to come back from Luza from Monday and I only got my access to my computer yesterday, but I cannot access to me. And I did call yesterday. I do have a ticket number. And the reason if I spoke to yesterday said my supervisor has to send me a request to remove me from LOA because I was still showing on LOA. My supervisor has already done that since Monday. And that's how I got the access to my PC yesterday. So I came this morning. I still cannot access. So it is not. So you're saying that you are able to log into your system, but you are not able to access your teams. Am I right? Right. Do you want the ticket number from yesterday? Yes. Please. Can I have the ticket number, please? It's Inc. ********* ***. ********* *****. Correct. Can I have your BMS number, please? ******* *** I know your full name? Also? ***** *****. Ok, *****, just give me a moment. Let me check with the ticket which you have provided and I will get back to you on this. OK, so it may take a moment. May I put you on the hold for the same? OK?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 02:20 - endtime: 04:33]: Let me. It will show you the same performance on your order. You can log in with your account. The team is 75 million. Yes. Yes, yes. Exactly. You can hear it so much. Yes. You can just give us a contract. Yeah, it was sometimes due to the network issue that you'll get right. Okay. Yes. That's a problem. Yeah. Give me one moment. You want to start everything? Thank you. Very much. Thank you so much.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 04:33 - endtime: 07:24]: Thank you for staying on hold. ******. So I have just checked with the ticket and the BMS has gone active. So BMS is active now. So you are still not able to access the claims, right? Yes, the DNA was active since yesterday when I called. I had access to DMS, but I cannot access. Mmhmm. So it was also told to you that you need to get a ticket raise for the team's access. I'm sorry. So you were asked to get a ticket raised for the team's access. Are you going to submit the ticket? Your supervisor has to raise an RQ ticket for the teams that you are not able to access the teams. You have to. Your supervisor has to raise a ticket. Ok, and the approval that you have to submit the ticket because I spoke to, I guess what I was told yesterday and I messaged my supervisor and he said that he already has submitted a ticket since Monday. Do you have that number? No, I don't. So does he have to submit the ticket to you guys to help them for where to locate. So actually, what happens is your supervisor might have raised a request for the LOA to remove your name from the LOA. But for the team access, there would be a separate ticket. OK, our REQ ticket will be the separate one and that ticket will go to the UWA team. Ok, once the ticket, the UWA team checks with that and they will give you the access to the teams and they will send an email to your supervisor with the credentials. With those credentials, you will have to log in. Well, they did send the credentials yesterday. That's how I was able to log into my computer and to the. But that's all I have asked to resolve. Let me check because that's because your LOA. It was showing your showing was like LOA. Right? Just give me a moment. Let me check when the claims access or not. Hold on a second.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 07:24 - endtime: 10:51]: Please.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 10:51 - endtime: 12:44]: You for staying on hold. Hello. Yes, I'm here. So you are having. Yes, I can hear you. So you are having 3 license, which means you can have. You can use the teams in the browser. Can you try searching for teams dot microsoft dot com in the browser and check. Any? Does it make a real browser or not in browser? Any browser search for teams dot microsoft dot com? Well, I do have teams that just don't have access. And yesterday, the agent I spoke yesterday, he did uninstall teams and reinforced it again on my computer, but I still. Yes, that's because you're not having a license to use. I mean, you're not having the access to use the teams in the application. You can use it in the browser, not in the same application. OK, that's how OK, will this be resolved? Or what if you want to use the teams in the application? Your supervisor has to raise a ticket for the team's application access.
