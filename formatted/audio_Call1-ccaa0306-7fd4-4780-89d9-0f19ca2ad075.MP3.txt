Speaker 2 [starttime: 06:45 - endtime: 06:48]: Still not working.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 06:48 - endtime: 06:58]: No response from the CPU. My monitors working. Good. Working. Fine.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 06:57 - endtime: 06:59]: This is my personal monitors.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 06:59 - endtime: 07:05]: It should be fine. The only problem is the CPU.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 07:04 - endtime: 07:18]: Right. Can you please check if you can plug in the power cable of the monitor into the CPU? Just plug out the power cable of one of your monitors.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 07:18 - endtime: 07:20]: Power cable?

Speaker 2 [starttime: 07:20 - endtime: 07:22]: Yes.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 07:22 - endtime: 07:25]: Sure.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 07:25 - endtime: 07:38]: No. I mean, there must be a power cable on the backside of the monitor. Please check if you can use that power cable to connect with the CPU. Yes.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 07:38 - endtime: 07:42]: Yes, we can use the one because this is my power cable for my monitor.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 07:42 - endtime: 07:51]: It's under the candy. And can we also show me the other monitors? Power cable. So here.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 07:51 - endtime: 07:54]: The power cable monitor.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 07:54 - endtime: 08:03]: OK, so the power cable of the monitor is not compatible. Yeah, and.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 08:03 - endtime: 08:10]: See, I have no problem with my monitor because this is my personal monitors.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 08:09 - endtime: 08:12]: Ok.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 08:12 - endtime: 08:26]: If we tried it for the other one here. So I need a replacement as soon as possible for me so I can work today. I still have to ask for my key.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 08:26 - endtime: 08:44]: The only problem is OK, since the CPU is not showing any sign of power at all. So first I will have to proceed with the reflation of the power cable. Can you please pack out the power cable and point it towards the camera again so that I can take a snapshot of the same?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 08:44 - endtime: 08:46]: What was that again? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 08:45 - endtime: 09:30]: Should I take it off? Yes, Yes. Plug it out and point it towards the camera. I will take a snapshot for the type of this cable. Ok, I have taken a snapshot. You can close the camera for now. All right. And I will be proceeding to the replacement of the power cable. And if you are still facing issue after this replacement of the power cable, then I can proceed. I mean, the, it has excite port can proceed with the replacement of the CPU. But for now, first, I will have to proceed with the replacement of the power cable since it is not showing any sign of power at all.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 09:30 - endtime: 09:39]: No, there's no problem with the power cable. I can show you. I can use this one for my recipe if you would like, I need a replacement for the CP. You're not the power cable.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 09:39 - endtime: 09:56]: Okay, It'll take if you need to replace the power key, you can verify the power cable by plugging into your personal monitor. And I will just verify the same through this session. Then I can proceed with the replacement of the CPU directly.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 09:56 - endtime: 09:59]: All right, let me just try it again. To my.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 09:59 - endtime: 10:00]: Here.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 10:00 - endtime: 10:09]: I have my personal pieces here. I can show you that the that power cable is working and I'll give you the replacement for the CPU, not the power cable.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 10:09 - endtime: 10:11]: Ok.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 10:11 - endtime: 10:20]: That will take me a long time if I will wait for the power for the power for this project.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 10:20 - endtime: 10:25]: It. Ok.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 10:25 - endtime: 10:36]: Just a moment. I need a placement for the experience and the power.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 10:35 - endtime: 11:02]: I'm sorry. I mean, can you please use the same PowerPoint for this cable? I mean, the issue can be with the PowerPoint as well. No, the power socket. Can you please try to use the same power socket for both of the cpus? I mean, the power socket can be faulty as well. Right. Since you're using an extension.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:02 - endtime: 11:15]: Oh, sure. You can try it. There's no faults here. It's all running. I have, I'm using ahead with you that extension and there's no problem with all of that.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 11:14 - endtime: 11:17]: OK, I see. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:17 - endtime: 11:28]: The monitor is turning on, I think switch again here. The money was still turning on. So there's no problem.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 11:28 - endtime: 11:31]: Ok.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:31 - endtime: 11:34]: This is a new one. And this is.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 11:34 - endtime: 11:55]: OK, you can just verify the power cable and then we will just have to do, I think power drain as well. But then I will be able to proceed with the replacement of the CPU. First verify the power cable with the other CPU. OK, here, here it is.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 11:55 - endtime: 11:59]: Try this one.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 11:59 - endtime: 12:01]: It.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 12:01 - endtime: 12:06]: But this disappears. Not working. I'll just show you that this PowerCard is working.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 12:06 - endtime: 12:40]: OK, Ok. All right. Here it is. OK. OK, yes. The power is working. Now we will just have to do a power drain off the CPU as well to try to fix this issue. And if that starts your CPU, then I will be just creating an input for.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 12:40 - endtime: 12:41]: My CPU.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 12:41 - endtime: 12:53]: Yes. I mean, after removing all the cables from the CPU, the company provided CPU. Just go back to your main system. The company provided system, OK?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 12:53 - endtime: 13:04]: I'll just take this one. Yes. Shall I unplug it all and then plug it again?

Speaker 2 [starttime: 13:04 - endtime: 13:10]: Yes. I mean, unplug. Yes. Unplug all the cables. And then.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 13:10 - endtime: 13:27]: All that many times. There's no problem with the sockets or any ports here. The problem is.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 13:27 - endtime: 13:46]: OK. No. Actually, before plugging in all the cables, hold the power button of the CPU to to drain all the charge from the CPU. Just hold it for 10 to 15 seconds. Ok?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 13:46 - endtime: 13:48]: Just let me know once.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 13:48 - endtime: 13:54]: Ok, keep holding it.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 13:54 - endtime: 13:58]: Mmhmm.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 13:58 - endtime: 14:21]: A little bit longer. Ok, now just plug back into power cable and check again if now the CPU is starting and if it is still not plugging, Yes. Just plug into power cable.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 14:21 - endtime: 14:23]: Just a minute.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 14:23 - endtime: 14:37]: Thanks. Yeah. Do you have dogs? I can take this one. See? It's okay. I can.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 14:41 - endtime: 15:22]: Ok. then press only one, Correct? Yes. Just to normally start the system. Ok, OK, then I will be proceeding with the replacement of the CPU. Can you please just show me the backside of the CPU so that I can verify all the ports that are. Available on the CPU. OK. Okay. And there must be an asset tag on the CPU on the top side mentioning the asset tag of this CPU. It will be a teleper performance.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 15:22 - endtime: 15:25]: I'm sorry.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 15:24 - endtime: 15:31]: Yeah. Please show me the telephone speaker on the right side.
