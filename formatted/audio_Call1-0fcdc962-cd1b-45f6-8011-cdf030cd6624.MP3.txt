Speaker 2 [starttime: 02:28 - endtime: 02:31]: You, ma'am.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 02:31 - endtime: 02:32]: To resolve the account.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 02:32 - endtime: 02:33]: That's what happened.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 02:33 - endtime: 02:39]: So you need to tell me which applications are missing.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 02:38 - endtime: 03:11]: Ok, so when I initially switched on the screen, I struggled to find my VPN. Oh, eventually I found it. And then there was a bit more struggle to log into the VPN. It wasn't straightforward. I managed to do that. I've got into the VPN when he brought up my BMS screen. Eventually its come up. I it was another struggle to sign into a VM EMS details as well. It's got me into a BMS home application folders that were saved in the top page. BMS or can you?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 03:11 - endtime: 03:16]: Tell me which login procedure you're using.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 03:23 - endtime: 03:26]: Improve a VPN log. VPN login.

Speaker 1 [starttime: 03:26 - endtime: 03:38]: So first when we turn on the system, we unlock the screen. Right Control alt delete. Once you unlock this claim, then we'll connect with the VP. Correct?

Speaker 1 [starttime: 03:41 - endtime: 03:45]: Ok, and then with the other name.

Speaker 2 [starttime: 03:45 - endtime: 04:18]: So normally, what happened with my own PC? Normally, just like on the right hand side, there's a double monitor screen, click button and click on that. Then that allows me to log into VPN. So do that. Then it allows me to log in with my password and my username. Then it opens up my BMS. When it opens up my BMS, it allows me to then log into my IEF schedule and all the other apps I need to. Then I go into my DWPT tricks and I can open all my pages for that. Like I said today. No problem. Oh, ma'am, I.
